<p>2021-2-18:&nbsp;Hey Guys, I hope you're doing all right lately. Congratulation! We have recently submitted our final version of the Milestone 0 document to our TA. Thank you all for the efforts you made Milestone 0. We look forward to continuing the good work accomplished in Milestone 1. At the same time, I hope that everyone will offer to attend the group meeting twice a week so that we can interact and communicate more effectively. Furthermore, I expect that all members will be able to share what you have achieved on the Discord platform once you have completed your parts of the work. This is a good way of avoiding repetitive work and improving effectiveness. Keep up with the excellent status everybody! @everyone &nbsp;</p>

<p>2021-3-11:&nbsp;The main topic of today's meeting: UI/ UX design and implmentation. Participants: Ziming, Dominic, Jessica&nbsp;</p>
